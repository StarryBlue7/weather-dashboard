# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard for displaying weather reports for multiple cities, utilizing data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Cities can be searched for by name and are kept in a search history displayed below the input, up to a maximum of 10. The newest searched cities are added to the top of the list, and any repeat searches are moved to the top of the list. This search history is retained across sessions, and on page load, the most recently searched city is shown automatically.

### Mobile View

The dashboard has also been optimized for mobile viewing, with the search history being collapsed into a scrollable section.
